0.02
0.03
0.04
0.05	- Many highly experimental versions experimenting with alternative
	  formats for function signatures, etc. None provided significant
          improvements in functionality.

1.00  Tue Oct 31 14:47:45 2000
	- Tidied up
	- Implemented workaround for DynaLoader problems on ActiveState
	  binary build
	- Set version to 1.00, to reflect "final" status

1.01  Thu Jun 19 22:04:59 2003
	Installation improvements.
	- FFI now uses the _installed_ ffcall libraries and headers,
	  rather than those in the ./ffcall directory.
	- Linux installation now works.
	- Fixed two warnings in FFI.xs.
	- Replaced the old ./ffcall contents with the current ffcall-1.8.
	- t/basic.t now uses Test, and win32.t was tweaked.  Hopefully the
	  automated module testers will now be happier.

1.02  2007-02-07
    Maintenance release.
    - Probe for a system ffcall instead of bundling its sources.
    - For Windows, bundle prebuilt ffcall-1.10 libs. (Works with
      Strawberry Perl and MSVC-built perls, including ActivePerl.)

1.03  2007-12-26
    Maintenance release.
    - Fix build on cygwin (Thanks Reini Urban). Closes #31913.

1.04  2008-09-06
    Maintenance release.
    - Avoid CPAN testers emails when libffi is not installed.

CURRENT WORK
    Working on switch to use Alien::FFCall and, therefore, Module::Build
